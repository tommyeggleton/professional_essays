# Kanban for everything!

When we talk about Product we end up talking about Project Management. Project Management can get as detailed and complex as any field. However, for companies smaller than say 300 employees, it’s best to keep the process as light-touch as possible. The value in Product Management comes from testing, learning, and executing as quickly as possible. If we get a “good enough” framework for doing things we can make the Product process as smooth and intuitive as possible.

## Let’s get straight to it

I’m a huge fan of not repeating what others have done better. Rather than read my opinion on this, you can spend a very profitable hour watching [Eric Brechner’s talk on kanban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD0y-aU1sXo "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD0y-aU1sXo"). Alternatively, you can rip through his very slim [book on the subject](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Project-Management-Kanban-Developer-Practices/dp/0735698953 "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Project-Management-Kanban-Developer-Practices/dp/0735698953"). 

## Let’s dive in - the case for kanban

If you don’t know how to use kanban, watch that video. 

However, if you’re still here, these are my two pennies.

At its heart, kanban is a tool for forcing a team to do fewer things at one time and to keep pushing those things until they are absolutely complete. The narrower pipe accelerates the delivery of any one project and, because all projects take less time it also accelerates the delivery of all projects that the team chooses to deliver.

Kanban is, by definition, a tool for “just in time” work. Less effort is wasted because you only work on projects that you are confident (1) need doing and (2) will be finished. 

Forcing your team to reduce the “work in progress” rather than starting new projects when the pipeline is full encourages them to muck in and unblock projects even if they’re not specialists in an area (for example, they may be weaker at analysis, engineering, testing, or rollout of projects but they will get experience by collaborating with more experienced team members). This is interesting for a few reasons. 

First, you remove key man risk as new team members become familiar with all steps of the process. 

Second, you remove the demoralising effect of too many specialists with not enough to do. 

Third, you cut out the psychologically draining effect of producing lots of detailed, spec-heavy plans (“roadmaps”) that inevitably change before work begins and render all that planning redundant. 

Sometimes a single project produces a big leap forward. Now a team no longer needs to worry about the problem they were previously solving. This is success but it also means that the team needs something else to do. With kanban, this could not be more simple. The team just figures out the new focus, re-orders their backlog, and calmly gets back to work. A change in priorities isn’t an emergency any more, it’s just the way that the team works. 

The fewer moving pieces you have at once, the easier it is to track work and to get those projects done. Collaboration becomes much easier as teammates stop being pulled in different directions with different priorities. Nailing those few things is everyone’s priority.

## Starting afresh

Spinning up a new team is trivial using kanban. You grab a bunch of people, give them some goals and give them a list of things they _could_ work on. The team picks the most likely projects, figures out a couple of stages with definitions of done then works together to deliver only those projects. If the projects work and achieve the goal, the team gets a new goal. If the projects don’t deliver the desired results, the team picks a few more likely projects and knocks them out too.

## Final thoughts

A pared down pipeline of work in progress means that there’s no way to hide the success or failure of the process. There’s no project noise hiding inefficiencies in the team. Plus, kanban pairs beautifully with Living Checklists (see [You need living checklists](you-need-living-checklists.md))
