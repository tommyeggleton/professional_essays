# You need living checklists

Every team delivers something. Maybe they deliver a physical product, boxed and shiny. Maybe they write software or help customers. 

In an ideal world, the delivery should take only as long as is absolutely necessary. Process bottlenecks artificially slow delivery. Quality issues crop up that cause re-work. Missed communication causes delays. Teams find themselves fixing the same problems over and over again in different contexts.

A living checklist can help here.

A “living checklist” is just a checklist that a team agrees to use for now. Importantly, the checklist can be modified quickly with feedback from the team. It’s not the voice of management from on high saying “do this or you're fired”. The team will have to include steps to make sure that company standards and the law are obeyed but they will also include steps that make it easier for the next person in the process to pick up where the last person left off. It’s there to make both the end product better and the process of delivery as stable and quick as possible. 

So now you know there are 2 parts: (1) a checklist exists that the team agrees to use whilst working and (2) that checklist will be changed as the team finds convincing reasons to change it. 

If you’re dubious about the usefulness of checklists or worried that they stymie your creativity, flexibility, or autonomy then I recommend reading Atul Gawande’s “The Checklist Manifesto”. He does a wonderful job of demonstrating the enormous improvements that can be made in all sorts of situations, even with extremely capable and well-trained individuals.

In a nutshell, checklists are so effective because they force the standardisation of processes as far as possible, remove scope for forgetfulness, and provide visual feedback. As for stymying creativity, remember that a checklist is a starting point and a framework, a minimum standard which your work must hit rather than an arbitrary and unthinking limit upon what can be done.

No one remembers everything, checklists remove the uncertainty.

The order in which you do things matters and saves time, checklists provide the guide rails for that order. This is especially valuable if the project is going to fail. In those circumstances it’s best to find out early and move on. 

However, the reality of reality is that circumstances change. Team members dream up new and better ways to do things. Experiments reveal hidden methods and dangers. The laws in which you operate change. A checklist carved in stone would quickly become a millstone around your neck. There’s no reason to keep blindly following the same process. You just need a method for tweaking your process that allows your team to transition smoothly.

As you work you will bump into problems. If you can figure out a solution to that problem you can decide to add the solution to the checklist. If you generate a fresh copy of the checklist as you start each chunk of work then you can even add steps that you’re considering to only that checklist which allows you to test the effectiveness of your change against the old process. 

There are lots of points to review and consider adding steps to your checklist. In your daily standup you can raise an issue you’re seeing and suggest steps that would remove it. If you’re running retros then that’s an obvious opportunity to review the checklist’s performance. If you’ve got a bigger team or you’re a big fan of totally asynchronous behaviour or you have a lot of stakeholders that need to pitch in, any team member could write up a proposal for a new step to get feedback and buy-in from the team. 

Often it’s better to have an itchy trigger finger and add a step to the process, even if it’s just for a couple of projects, to prove or disprove its usefulness quickly. That’s better than spending too long weighing the pros and cons of a new step and getting stuck in dogmatism. If someone has an idea and it’s not obviously fatally flawed, add it to the process for a while to learn by doing

There are other great benefits to a process driven with living checklists. For one, having a checklist which must be completed step-by-step allows your team to manage projects without the need for infernal project status updates and the ringing around the houses to get that update. You know who needs to do what when.

This is perfectly compatible with Kanban (my personal preference) and any Agile methodology. In fact, a proper “definition of done” is essential to Kanban and living checklists are an evolving definition of done and safety rails all in one. 

Why not give it a try for a month or so? See if your team likes it and it produces more and higher quality work. It’s the easiest thing in the world to throw the checklist away if it does no good.

## Some useful examples of checklist steps

### Delivering a new feature

- Gathering stakeholders
- Defining the problem
- Agreeing the deliverables based on wireframes.
- Making sure that features are documented, delivered to the users, and users know how to (training) and can use (permissions) the feature. See also:
    - [Your documentation is everything](your-documentation-is-everything.md)
    - [Demonstrate and deliver - getting use out of your features](demonstrate-and-deliver.md)

### New hires

- Understand software and permissions requirements from job description
- Setup laptop
- Uniform/equipment 
- Policy training
- Team introductions
