# Get the heck off of Slack!

If you want to do really good work, fast then you need 2 things: the unbroken time to do it and public accountability and recognition for that work.

A lot of people have talked about the productivity-killing and satisfaction-sapping effect of real-time communication. Cal Newport makes a brilliant case for getting away from it in [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B013UWFM52 "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B013UWFM52"). Jason Fried shows how it ruins your ability to get things done in [It Doesn’t Have to be Crazy at Work](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Doesnt-Have-Be-Crazy-Work/dp/B07GBBBGNW "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Doesnt-Have-Be-Crazy-Work/dp/B07GBBBGNW"). We know that attention-switching is draining, causes mistakes, and generally makes us unhappy. 

It’s far better to allow people to get into a deep work mode. 

For me, the way I do it is I turn off Slack, Teams, and Outlook. I set my phone to do-not-disturb, set a loud timer for 40 minutes, and put the phone in a metal cabinet next to my desk. Then I get to work. With no phone to hand and a defined finishing time, I am pulled into a productive state that feels as close to “flow” as I have experienced. 

After 40 minutes, the buzzer goes off. I normally work for another 5 minutes to finish my thoughts and then stretch, maybe check an email or two (though this is often NOT a good idea), and either take a break or move on to my next task. 

There are some obvious objections to this way of working but I’m not sure that they hold water. 

> **"I object! Not being available immediately holds people up if they need responses or access to get their work done”**

If you don’t know how to do something, try to figure it out. Take your best effort stab at it and then send an email to the person who might know the “right answer”. It might be that you figure out a better way. If you are absolutely certain that you’re blocked, send that email or schedule a call and work on something else in the meantime. 

Access blocks happen but hopefully they cause a blockage once and then you figure out a better process for the future or you simply get unblocked for now. It should really only be a matter of a day. The one day hypothetical blockage is by far worth it if it allows many days of deep work. 

Take onboarding seriously and use Kanban to do things right the first time. 

> **“I object! We’re a collaborative team”**

There’s an important difference between being genuinely collaborative (working together to solve a single problem) and having a team which is working separately but constantly interrupting one another with questions related to their specific stream. 

If you’re working on the same problem, there’s a good argument for working on one computer or on one whiteboard. If you’re not, work truly separately and allow yourselves to focus. 

> **“I object! I need to see that my team is online”**

This is presenteeism, which is naff, and poor management, because by keeping people online you’re ensuring that they’re likely to be distracted. It’s also not a particularly good way of keeping track of what people are doing. Build a culture where you do just one thing at a time. If you (yourself, your team, your company) are trying to do too many things at once and too many people have been assigned too many tasks simultaneously then of course they’re overwhelmed and under-delivering. If they had one thing to work on and then came back to the manager with an update it would soon be the manager overwhelmed finding them tasks to do. Better to cut that hassle for everyone and switch to a nice, public Kanban and then let people get on with their work unhurriedly but undistractedly. Even better, you can genuinely help people when they get stuck.

> **“I object! We need to put out fires!”**

Sure, yes. However, you light more fires when you’re doing more things at once. Have you switched to Kanban yet and committed to doing things right the first time? 

Also, there are going to be system events that disrupt the business. 

We assign a “bug catcher” whose job it is to be available in realtime, to triage issues, make really quick fixes if absolutely necessary, and to pull others in if the issue is a genuine emergency that cannot wait a couple of hours. To this end, it’s helpful to have a “batphone”, a super cheap phone that employees have to be contacted upon if totally necessary during deep work. It’s not a smart phone, it’s a brick with a pre-paid SIM. Not a distraction tool, just a last-ditch measure.

Also, get better containment measures! 

Also also, go bug zero. 

> **“I object! We have a lot of junior engineers who need support”** 

Sure, yes. But also make sure they “have a go”. And collaborate with them (in the true sense) rather than hanging them out to dry or drip-feeding them information via Slack. Do better at onboarding and the pastoral work of bringing in new team members.
