In my experience, it’s pretty easy to train a person with the right aptitude to manage “Product”. Therefore, I don’t put a ton of focus on years of experience as long as I have the time to train. See “How to train Product professionals”.
Finding candidates with the right aptitude is straightforward. My process goes something like this:
- Get CVs and covering letters by advertising. You can advertise for “Product” or more generically for problem solvers. You typically don’t need to mention the technologies you use. These are unimportant.
- Read the CV and covering letter. If they’re difficult to read, reject them. If the documents between them have more than 2 mis-seplled wrods, reject them ;)
- Rate the CV and covering letters out of 5 on:    
    - Fluency (1-5)
    - Clarity (1-5)
- Take your highest scoring subset (maybe 3-5 depending on how many CVs you’ve received) and ask the candidates to outline an approach to a small business problem in writing. Insist on no more than 600 words. You want to be respectful of your candidate's time. Set a deadline. Reject any who miss the deadline.
- When you have the responses, rate them on:
    - Clarity + Fluency (1-5)
    - User Empathy (1-5)
    - Attention to data/hard statistics (1-5)
    - Inventiveness (1-5)
    - Bonus +5 for a document with at least one diagram.
- Ask an engineer and designer to respond to the best scoring subset’s problem document with sketched designs and areas to consider. This should take them no more than 15-20 minutes. Make sure that they include at least 1 challenge/technical consideration.
- Send the document with feedback to the candidate/s and ask them to break that down into a first-cut delivery plan. Make it clear that this isn’t final, it’s just to start the conversation about delivery.
- Assess the quality of the delivery plan:
    - Clarity (1-5)
    - Acceptance and acknowledgement of engineer and designer challenges (1-5)
    - +2 for giving at least 25% of the total time over to testing
    - +3 for talking about rollout to actual users and gathering feedback
- Hire the best-scoring candidates.
Note, there’s no in-person interview. I really don’t worry about verbal fluency and personal presentation. I care so much more about the quality of written communication, unhurried thinking, and attention to the experience of the team. And this ends up taking no more than an hour per candidate.
Hire fast, commit to training, commit to maintaining an objective BAU process, and fire fast if it’s not working out.
