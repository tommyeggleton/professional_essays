Simple idea. Once you’ve made or modified a feature that you want people to use, meet with them. 

In that meeting:
1. Tell them what you’ve built. 
2. Show them how you use it. 
3. Watch them all use it to do the same things you just showed.  
    

This way you don’t need to worry about people not knowing what you built. 
This way you prove to yourselves that everything shipped to Production correctly.
This way you solve any permission issues immediately.
This way you advertise your good work and build a good relationship with the customer. 
  
Add this stage to your kanban and thank me later.
